Box for Salesforce Blueprints is a collection of examples designed to work with the Box for Salesforce managed package. These samples are designed to be used for demonstration, development, and test purposes.

## Pre-Requisites

2. Setup your Salesforce DX environment: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/projects/quick-start-salesforce-dx/set-up-your-salesforce-dx-environment
3. Setup VS Code: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-lightning-web-components/set-up-visual-studio-code

5. Install and Configure the Box for Salesforce Managed Package: https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-Integrations/Installing-and-Configuring-Box-For-Salesforce/ta-p/180
    > Note: Dont forget to add the Box VisualForce components to each of the record type layouts.

6. Install the Box Salesforce SDK Unmanaged Package:
    
    * Production/Developer Org: https://cloud.box.com/Box-Apex-SDK

9. Confirm you've successfully authorized your org by listing orgs and their associated status:
```
sfdx force:org:list
```
10. List the installed packaged for your org:
```
sfdx force:package:installed:list -u <username@domain.com>
```
11. Locate the Box for Salesforce package and copy the PACKAGE ID and VERSION into a new dependencies json element of the sfdx-project.json located at the root project directory.

It should looks something like this:
```
{
  "packageDirectories": [
    {
      "path": "force-app",
      "default": true
    }
  ],
  "namespace": "",
  "sfdcLoginUrl": "https://login.salesforce.com",

  "dependencies": [
    { 
      "package" : "033700000004yvWAAQ",
      "versionNumber": "3.56.0.1"
    },
    { 
      "package" : "0334P000000kKiUQAU",
      "versionNumber": "1.0.0.1"
    }
  ]
}
```
13. Deploy you project source to either you scratch org or developer org in the next section.

## Deploy to your Org

```
sfdx force:source:push
```

```
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app -u username@company.com
